# Complete Problem Analysis: NumPy Types & Database Issues

## 🎯 What Happened?

You encountered **two different but related problems** when trying to save financial data to your PostgreSQL database:

1. **Problem #1**: NumPy Schema Error
2. **Problem #2**: Duplicate Key Constraint Violation

Let's understand each one step by step.

## 🔍 Problem #1: The NumPy Schema Error

### What Was the Error?
```
schema "np" does not exist
LINE 1: ...INTEGER FROM (VALUES ('AAPL', '2024-08-19'::date, np.float64...
```

### Why Did This Happen?

#### Step 1: Understanding Data Types
When you use `yfinance` to get stock data, it returns a **pandas DataFrame**:
```python
stock = yf.Ticker("AAPL")
hist = stock.history(period="1y")
print(type(hist['Open'][0]))  # Output: <class 'numpy.float64'>
```

#### Step 2: The Problem Chain
1. **yfinance** gives you data with **NumPy data types** (np.float64, np.int64, etc.)
2. You try to save this data to your **database model**:
   ```python
   db_record = models.OhlcvData(
       open=row['Open'],  # This is np.float64(224.67)
       high=row['High'],  # This is np.float64(224.94)
       # ...
   )
   ```
3. **SQLAlchemy** tries to create a SQL query
4. Instead of converting `np.float64(224.67)` to just `224.67`, SQLAlchemy literally puts `np.float64(224.67)` in the SQL
5. **PostgreSQL** sees `np.float64(...)` and thinks `np` is a **schema name** (like a database namespace)
6. Since schema `np` doesn't exist → **ERROR!**

### The Root Cause
```python
# ❌ WRONG: NumPy types confuse PostgreSQL
open_value = row['Open']  # np.float64(224.67)

# ✅ CORRECT: Standard Python types work fine
open_value = float(row['Open'])  # 224.67 (regular Python float)
```

## 🔍 Problem #2: Duplicate Key Constraint Violation

### What Was the Error?
```
duplicate key value violates unique constraint "_ticker_date_uc"
DETAIL: Key (ticker, date)=(AAPL, 2024-08-19) already exists.
```

### Why Did This Happen?

#### Your Database Setup
You have a **unique constraint** in your database:
```sql
-- In your database table
CONSTRAINT _ticker_date_uc UNIQUE (ticker, date)
```

This means: **"You cannot have two records with the same ticker AND same date"**

#### The Problem Chain
1. You run your API endpoint: `/api/v/data/ohlcv/AAPL`
2. Your code fetches data and tries to save it
3. **First time**: Works fine! ✅
4. **Second time**: You run the same endpoint again
5. Your code tries to `INSERT` the same data again
6. Database says: **"Hey! AAPL for 2024-08-19 already exists!"** ❌

### Why `merge()` Didn't Work
```python
db.merge(db_record)  # This should handle duplicates, but didn't work
```

`SQLAlchemy.merge()` is tricky because:
- It needs your model to have a **properly configured primary key**
- It might not understand your **custom unique constraint**
- Sometimes it just doesn't work as expected with complex constraints

## 🛠️ The Complete Solution Explained

### Solution Part 1: Fix NumPy Types

```python
def convert_numpy_types(value):
    """Convert NumPy types to standard Python types."""
    if pd.isna(value):          # Handle NaN/missing values
        return None
    if isinstance(value, np.integer):  # np.int64 → int
        return int(value)
    elif isinstance(value, np.floating):  # np.float64 → float
        return float(value)
    elif isinstance(value, np.ndarray):   # arrays → lists
        return value.tolist()
    elif isinstance(value, (np.number)):  # catch any other numpy types
        return float(value)
    return value  # if it's already a standard Python type
```

**Why This Works:**
- Converts `np.float64(224.67)` → `224.67` (Python float)
- PostgreSQL understands Python floats perfectly
- No more schema errors!

### Solution Part 2: Handle Duplicates Properly

#### Option A: Check Before Insert
```python
# Check if record already exists
existing_record = db.query(models.OhlcvData).filter(
    models.OhlcvData.ticker == ticker_upper,
    models.OhlcvData.date == record_date
).first()

if existing_record:
    print("Record already exists, skipping")
    continue  # Skip this record

# Only insert if it doesn't exist
db_record = models.OhlcvData(...)
db.add(db_record)
```

#### Option B: Use Database-Level Upsert
```sql
INSERT INTO ohlcv_data (ticker, date, open, high, low, close, volume)
VALUES ('AAPL', '2024-08-19', 224.67, ...)
ON CONFLICT (ticker, date) 
DO UPDATE SET 
    open = EXCLUDED.open,    -- Update with new values
    high = EXCLUDED.high,
    ...
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Option A**: Prevents the duplicate insert attempt entirely
- **Option B**: Tells PostgreSQL "If duplicate, update instead of error"

## 🧠 Key Learning Points

### 1. **Data Type Awareness**
- Different libraries use different data types
- Always check what type of data you're working with: `print(type(your_variable))`
- Databases prefer standard Python types (int, float, str) over library-specific types

### 2. **Database Constraints Are Your Friend (And Enemy)**
- **Friend**: They prevent bad data from entering your database
- **Enemy**: They can cause errors if you don't handle them properly
- Always think: "What happens if I run this code twice?"

### 3. **Error Messages Are Clues**
```
schema "np" does not exist
```
This told us that `np` (NumPy) was being treated as a database schema, which meant NumPy types weren't being converted properly.

```
duplicate key value violates unique constraint
```
This told us exactly what constraint was violated and what values caused it.

### 4. **The Three-Step Debugging Process**
1. **What**: What exactly is the error?
2. **Why**: Why is this happening? (trace the data flow)
3. **How**: How do we fix it? (address the root cause)

## 🔧 How to Prevent This in Future

### 1. **Always Convert External Data Types**
```python
# When working with pandas/numpy data
def safe_convert_for_db(value):
    """Always use this when saving to database"""
    if pd.isna(value):
        return None
    if isinstance(value, (np.integer, np.floating, np.number)):
        return float(value) if isinstance(value, np.floating) else int(value)
    return value
```

### 2. **Always Handle Duplicates**
When designing any "fetch and store" function, ask:
- "What if this data already exists?"
- "Should I skip, update, or error?"
- "How do I handle this gracefully?"

### 3. **Test Your Code Twice**
- Run your endpoint once ✅
- Run it again immediately ✅
- If the second run fails, you have a duplicate handling problem

### 4. **Use Type Hints and Logging**
```python
def get_ohlcv(ticker: str, period: str = "1y", db: Session = None) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Fetches OHLCV data and stores it in database.
    Handles duplicates gracefully.
    Converts NumPy types to Python types.
    """
    logger.info(f"Fetching {period} data for {ticker}")
    # ... rest of your code
```
