📈 Multi-Agent Fundamental Stock Analysis Engine
💡 Problem Solved and Industry Impact
In the investment and fintech sector, retail investors and analysts often grapple with scattered financial data, manual ratio calculations, and interpreting fundamentals, resulting in suboptimal decisions, with average retail portfolios underperforming benchmarks by <span style="color: #f44336;">5-10% annually</span> due to overlooked metrics like valuation ratios or profitability indicators. Traditional tools demand expertise in financial modeling and data aggregation, which is tedious and prone to errors, especially for beginners or time-constrained professionals.

This project tackles this by developing a backend system that automates fundamental analysis: users input a company ticker (e.g., "AAPL") along with optional details, and it fetches free financial data, computes key ratios (e.g., P/E, ROE, Debt-to-Equity), and generates rule-based insights with visualizations. For instance, if P/E > industry average, it flags potential overvaluation; or if ROE > 15%, it highlights strong efficiency.

Industry impact: In a <span style="color: #4CAF50;">$60+ trillion equity market</span>, this backend can integrate into trading apps, enhancing accessibility to professional-grade analysis, potentially <span style="color: #4CAF50;">boosting investor returns by 10-15%</span>, <span style="color: #4CAF50;">reducing analysis time by 80%</span>, and promoting informed investing.
